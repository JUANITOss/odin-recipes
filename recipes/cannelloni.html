        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180â„ƒ/gas mark 4</li>
            <li>Heat a saucepan over a medium heat with a little oil and sweat down the onion and garlic without colouring</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper, bring to the boil then leave to simmer for around 20 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Add the basil</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, sweat down the spinach in a pan and drain off any excess moisture in a sieve</li>
            <li>Chop the spinach and place in a bowl with the ricotta and Parmesan. Beat in the egg, then season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Place half the sauce in the base of a baking dish. Transfer the filling mixture to a piping bag then pipe the mixture into the cannelloni and place them into the dish on top of the sauce</li>
            <li>Cover with the remaining tomato sauce and grated mozzarella and bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes, until a knife goes easily through the pasta and the top is golden brown</li>
            <li>Leave to rest for 5 minutes before dividing between plates and serving</li>
