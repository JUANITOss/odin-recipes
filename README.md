## What this project will be about...

This is my first odin-related project, so it will not look good at all. Later, I will be improving it up until the point I`m satisfied with the result.

## The learning path...

* I refreshed some basic HTML knowledge

* Understood the best practices when regarding to commit msgs and web 

* Got a better grasp of git!
